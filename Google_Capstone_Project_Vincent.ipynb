      "Abstract:\n",
      "Pretrained Foundation Models (PFMs) are regarded as the foundation for various downstream tasks with different data modalities. A PFM (e.g., BERT, ChatGPT, and GPT-4) is trained on large-scale data which provides a reasonable parameter initialization for a wide range of downstream applications. BERT learns bidirectional encoder representations from Transformers, which are trained on large datasets as contextual language models. Similarly, the generative pretrained transformer (GPT) method employs Transformers as the feature extractor and is trained using an autoregressive paradigm on large datasets. Recently, ChatGPT shows promising success on large language models, which applies an autoregressive language model with zero shot or few shot prompting. The remarkable achievements of PFM have brought significant breakthroughs to various fields of AI. Numerous studies have proposed different methods, raising the demand for an updated survey. This study provides a comprehensive review of recent research advancements, challenges, and opportunities for PFMs in text, image, graph, as well as other data modalities. The review covers the basic components and existing pretraining methods used in natural language processing, computer vision, and graph learning. Additionally, it explores advanced PFMs used for different data modalities and unified PFMs that consider data quality and quantity. The review also discusses research related to the fundamentals of PFMs, such as model efficiency and compression, security, and privacy. Finally, the study provides key implications, future research directions, challenges, and open problems in the field of PFMs. Overall, this survey aims to shed light on the research of the PFMs on scalability, security, logical reasoning ability, cross-domain learning ability, and the user-friendly interactive ability for artificial general intelligence.\n",

      "Explanation with analogies:\n",
      "Okay, here are a few analogies to help understand Pretrained Foundation Models (PFMs), broken down with the core concept:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Core Concept: PFMs are like highly skilled, pre-trained professionals who can adapt to many jobs because they have a strong foundational knowledge.**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Analogy 1: The Master Craftsman**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **PFM:** A master craftsman, let's say a carpenter, who has spent years learning all the fundamental woodworking skills: cutting, joining, finishing, etc. They've practiced on countless projects.\n",
      "*   **Large-Scale Training Data:** All the years the carpenter spent in apprenticeship and working on various projects, from simple boxes to complex furniture. This experience built their skillset.\n",
      "*   **Downstream Tasks:** The different jobs the carpenter can now take on. They can build a bookshelf, a table, a house frame, or even a sculpture. They can apply their foundational skills to a variety of tasks.\n",
      "*   **BERT, ChatGPT, GPT-4:** These are different toolsets within the carpenter's workshop. BERT is like a specialized tool for quickly analyzing and understanding existing wooden structures. ChatGPT/GPT-4 is like a design tool that can generate new blueprints based on different styles and requirements.\n",
      "*   **Significance of PFMs:** The carpenter's expertise allows them to create high-quality products efficiently and effectively. They don't need to be taught the basics of woodworking every time they start a new project.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Analogy 2: The Well-Stocked Kitchen & Chef**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **PFM:** A restaurant kitchen that is completely stocked with high-quality ingredients and tools. Think of it as a kitchen that is prepared to make a variety of dishes.\n",
      "*   **Large-Scale Training Data:** The abundance of diverse ingredients and tools available in the kitchen. The more ingredients and tools, the more recipes (tasks) the chef can create.\n",
      "*   **Downstream Tasks:** The different dishes the chef can prepare – pizza, sushi, cake, stew, salad, etc. The kitchen's foundational stock of ingredients allows for a wide range of culinary creations.\n",
      "*   **BERT, ChatGPT, GPT-4:** Different culinary techniques or appliances. BERT is like a technique for analyzing flavors and ingredients to optimize a dish. ChatGPT/GPT-4 is like a recipe generator that can create new and unique dishes based on available ingredients.\n",
      "*   **Significance of PFMs:** The well-stocked kitchen enables the chef to be creative and efficient, and quickly adapt to different customer requests. They don't have to start from scratch every time someone orders something new.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Analogy 3: The Multilingual Polyglot**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **PFM:** Imagine someone who has learned to speak and understand many different languages (English, Spanish, French, Mandarin, etc.).\n",
      "*   **Large-Scale Training Data:** All the books, conversations, and cultural experiences the person had while learning those languages.\n",
      "*   **Downstream Tasks:** The different things the person can *do* with their language skills: translate documents, write articles, have conversations with people from different countries, learn new languages more easily.\n",
      "*   **BERT, ChatGPT, GPT-4:** Different dialects or specialized vocabulary. BERT is like a tool for analyzing the structure of a sentence to understand its meaning. ChatGPT/GPT-4 is like a creative writing tool that can generate different kinds of text formats based on a user's prompts.\n",
      "*   **Significance of PFMs:** The multilingual person can communicate and interact in various situations, understanding different cultures and contexts. They have a strong foundation that allows them to easily adapt to new communication challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, PFMs are valuable because they save time and effort by providing a strong starting point for many AI applications. Instead of building a model from scratch for each task, you can \"fine-tune\" a PFM, much like adapting a carpenter's skills to a specific job, adjusting a chef's recipe, or applying a multilingual person's knowledge to a particular translation task. The PFMs are powerful because they are pre-trained on a lot of data with large parameters, which is analogous to a craftsman who has a lot of experience under their belt and thus is highly skilled.\n",
